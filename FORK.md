# Fork notes

This fork tracks [Noamm9/NoammAddons](https://github.com/Noamm9/NoammAddons). Everything below exists
so that pulling upstream updates stays a one-command job.

## Syncing with upstream

```sh
git sync            # fetch upstream + rebase the current branch onto it (autostashes local edits)
git push --force-with-lease origin 26.1.2
```

`git sync` is a local alias for `git fetch upstream && git rebase --autostash upstream/<current branch>`.
Rebasing (not merging) keeps the fork as "upstream + a short list of my commits", which is what makes
the next sync cheap. The force-push is expected: rebasing rewrites the commits of this fork only.

The `upstream` remote is push-disabled on purpose, so `git push upstream` cannot go anywhere.

## Customisations

Keep every change to upstream files as small as possible, and put real code in new files. A patch that
touches 6 lines rebases cleanly for years, one that reorganises a file conflicts on every sync.

### Movable storage overlay

Lets the storage overlay be positioned and scaled from the hud editor (`/na` -> hud editor) like any
other hud element, instead of being locked to the centre of the screen.

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `features/impl/general/storageoverlay/StorageOverlayHud.kt` | **New.** The hud element: position, scale, and the editor preview. |
| `features/impl/general/storageoverlay/StorageOverlay.kt` | 1 line: registers the hud element. |
| `features/impl/general/storageoverlay/StorageOverlayScreen.kt` | 4 lines: `Measurements` anchors on the hud element, and the companion object is no longer private. |
| `ui/hud/HudElement.kt` | 1 word: `scale` is `open`, so the element can back it with the feature's own scale setting. |

Notes for when one of those lines conflicts:

* `StorageOverlayScreen.Measurements.x/y` must come from `StorageOverlayHud.panelX/panelY`, and
  `playerX` must be relative to `x` so the player inventory travels with the panel.
* `StorageOverlayHud` mirrors the column/width/height formulas of `Measurements` for its editor
  preview. If upstream changes that layout, the preview drifts (cosmetic only) until it is updated.
* The overlay stays screen-centred until it is actually moved. `x`/`y` default to `-1f`, which means
  "auto", and opening the hud editor converts that into a real position.
